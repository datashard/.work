Hey! Name's `datashard`, or _Joshua_ if you wanna use legal names.

I'm a Software Engineer, specializing in Frontend Development, though I have some fullstack experience.
Most of my work has been within the React Ecosystem, including, but not limited to,
working on a full-scale Web App for Corporate Controlling and the Managing, Creation, and Hosting of Websites for Creatives.

Currently based in Northern Germany and working in the Corporate Controlling sector as an Application Development Apprentice.

I've already worked with quite a big range of People as a Freelancer, starting with a few Collectives, like [Thrive or Die] and [Arte et Labore] as well as a few Artists, like [Sor], [Alex Heldt], and [Heika].

As well as some Corporate Clients like [Novecore].

<!-- Most of my work can be found on [Dribbble]
